# Election Analysis 

## Overview
To help Steve do stock research for his parents, I have created a spreadsheet using Excel VBA code.  There is a button that will activate a user input box to seperate the results by year.  In addition, due to the large volume of stock analysis data, I have added refactored code to take less steps, use less memory, and to improve the logic to make it easier for future users to read.

## Results
As you can see from the images below the refactored code spead up the run time.
